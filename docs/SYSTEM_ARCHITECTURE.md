# System Architecture

## Overview

SURMS is a full-stack web application that consists of a Django backend and a React frontend. The backend serves as an API provider and manages the database, while the frontend interacts with the backend via RESTful API calls.

## Components

### Backend
- **Django**: Web framework for the backend.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.

### Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### Deployment
- **Heroku**: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying the backend.
